# how to create a login page using ec2 instance with the help of http servers


1: create ur ec2 instance you can select either Linux or ubuntu 

2:allow https(22) and ssh (80) should be allowed 

3:launch your instance and connect it to ur local vms 

4: now give the commands below to install httpd to your local server 
	* sudo yum update -y
	* sudo yum install -y httpd
	* sudo systemctl start httpd
	* sudo systemctl enable httpd  
5: upload your html file on your httpd server , you need to upload and write file to the default document
 
	root directory /var/www/html/.

6: or you can create an html file on the local machine 

	sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html

7: paste your html content ,for example

	<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My AWS Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website on AWS EC2</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML page served by Apache on an EC2 instance.</p>
</body>
</html>


8:if your using your local machine ,use the following command

	scp -i <path-to-your-pem-file>.pem <path-to-your-html-file>.html ec2-user@<your-ec2-public-ip>:/var/www/html/

	ex:
		scp -i my-key.pem my-website.html ec2-user@54.123.45.67:/var/www/html/

9:you have to ensure the permissions to be served by httpd

	sudo chmod 644 /var/www/html/index.html

10:You also want to make sure the /var/www/html/ directory has the correct ownership and permissions:
	
	sudo chown -R ec2-user:ec2-user /var/www/html
	sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html
11:If you named the file something else, you can access it directly like this:

	http://<your-ec2-public-ip>/<your-html-file>.html
12: check whether the httpd is running or not ,check the status 

	sudo systemctl status httpd
13:By following these steps, your HTML file should be accessible via a browser through the public IP of your EC2 instance.
